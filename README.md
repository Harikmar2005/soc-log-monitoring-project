# SOC Log Monitoring and Alerting Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow focused on log monitoring, threat detection, alerting, and basic incident response.
It simulates real-world SOC activities by analyzing system and authentication logs to identify suspicious behavior such as brute-force login attempts and unauthorized access.



## 🎯 Objectives

Understand real-world SOC operations

Monitor and analyze security logs

Detect suspicious activities using alerts

Visualize security events using dashboards

Document incidents and mitigation steps



## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

SIEM Tool: Splunk

Operating Systems: Linux (Ubuntu / Kali Linux)

Networking Tool: Wireshark

Log Sources: System & authentication logs (sample data)

Documentation: Project presentation (PPT)

## 🏗 Project Workflow

Collect system and authentication logs

Ingest logs into Splunk

Analyze logs using searches and filters

Create dashboards for visualization

Configure alerts for suspicious activity

Investigate incidents and suggest mitigation

## 📊 Key Features

Detection of brute-force login attempts

Identification of suspicious IP addresses

Real-time dashboards for security monitoring

Alert rules based on defined thresholds

Incident analysis and response documentation

## 📈 Sample Use Case

Multiple failed login attempts detected from the same IP

Alert triggered in Splunk

SOC analyst investigates log details

Mitigation steps such as IP blocking or password reset are recommended

## 🔐 Security Note

All logs used in this project are simulated/sample data

No real credentials or sensitive information are included

Project is intended only for learning and academic purposes

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with SIEM tools

Understanding of SOC analyst responsibilities

Improved skills in log analysis and alerting

Basic incident response documentation

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Real-time log forwarding

Email / webhook alert notifications

Advanced correlation rules

Integration with IDS/IPS tools

## ✅ Conclusion

This project showcases practical knowledge of SOC operations, log monitoring, and threat detection, making it suitable for SOC Analyst and Security Analyst roles.
